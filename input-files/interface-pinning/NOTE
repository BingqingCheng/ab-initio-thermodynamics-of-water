This folder contains the input files for running interface pinning calculations.

You will need to use a lammps code patched with PLUMMED.

data.iceih-big is a proton-disordered ice Ih structure.

Steps:

* Substite the string "ttttt" with desired temperature.

* Scale the cell so that the lattice constant of ice is the equilibrium value at the specified temperature.

* Run 
lmp < in.lmp 
this simulation also dumps out restart files, which contains the coordinates solid-liquid coesistent systems.

* With the restart.sl file, one can continue the interface pinning simulations by 
lmp < continue.lmp
